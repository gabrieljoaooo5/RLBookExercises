Exercise 8.6 The analysis above assumed that all of the b possible next states were
equally likely to occur. Suppose instead that the distribution was highly skewed, that
some of the b states were much more likely to occur than most. Would this strengthen or
weaken the case for sample updates over expected updates? Support your answer.

Amostras de atualizações nesse contexo seriam mais próximas  para valores mais baixos de b porque existem menos estados importantes.
